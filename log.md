# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 16-12-2019


**Today's Progress**: Started a brand new project for my process model app using react js

**Thoughts:** I am struggling with finding the right attributes to get the coordinates of a html element. I found a copy of the drag and drop can be achieved using simple javascript code, but I wish to build the app in React JS. There are examples in the internet which shows how the drag and drop works in react, but I am yet find a concrete example.

### Day 1: 16-12-2019


**Today's Progress**: Was able to move the div component, although not properly

**Thoughts:** Need to understand how to capture dom positions in react.

### Day 2: 17-12-2019


**Today's Progress**:
                    1. Added react-bootstrap from https://react-bootstrap.github.io/
                    2. Implemented Menu
                    3. Implemented Drag from Menu


**Thoughts:** Need to understand how to bootstrap works with react, would probably need to implement Redux for dragging element. Need to implement multiple drags from the menu.

### Day 3: 18-12-2019


**Today's Progress**:
                    1. Implemented multiple drags.


**Thoughts:** Struggled with multiple drags but ultimately won :) There is an obvious need for an centralised store of data and from what I gather redux might be the answer. Although am getting good with javascript, I think I need to understand ES6 notation at some point.

### Day 4: 19-12-2019- 20-12-2019(2:27 am)


**Today's Progress**:
                    1. Tried and failed to implemented redux


**Thoughts:** Implementing redux might have been a mistake :(

### Day 5: 20-12-2019- 21-12-2019(1:43 am)


**Today's Progress**:
                    1. Implemented Redux and allow multiple item drag.
                    2. Implemented individual drag.


**Thoughts:** Really good learning of how redux works. Getting a hang of how to write imperative coding. Redux might not be so bad. Next is to join elements which might be a bit of challenge.

### Day 6: 21-12-2019- 22-12-2019(0:33 am)


**Today's Progress**:
                    1. Added multiple options to the menu.
                    2. Renamed few file to make it generic.


**Thoughts:** Need to find a way to have connectors, need to work on a solution to delete items from the canvas. Need to understand how css works.

### Day 7: 22-12-2019- 23-12-2019(0:13 am)


**Today's Progress**:
                    1. Added code for Line drag.


**Thoughts:** Found out svg will work for line, and tested creating svg in the app. Probably need to think about the react structure.

### Day 8: 23-12-2019- 24-12-2019(1:18 am)


**Today's Progress**:
                    1. Started working on another as a POC for Line drag


**Thoughts:** Need to get a working draw application. It might not be as easy as I was thinking about it.

### Day 9: 24-12-2019- 25-12-2019(0:46 am)


**Today's Progress**:
                    Finished POC, used svg to draw straight lines.


**Thoughts:** There are multiple ways of drawing lines in js, we can use canvas, a library konva which as a react plugin react-konva. I have used plain js and svg to draw lines. Next up I need to make line draw work in Process model app, may be in future I will add more functionality in the draw app.

### Day 10: 25-12-2019- 26-12-2019(2:12 am)


**Today's Progress**:
                    Continued POC to select and delete lines. sucessful partially.


**Thoughts:** Learnt about event.persist() . I need to learn how react works to make the most of the library. Need to change color of the object when selected.
