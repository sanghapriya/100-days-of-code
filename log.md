# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 16-12-2019


**Today's Progress**: Started a brand new project for my process model app using react js

**Thoughts:** I am struggling with finding the right attributes to get the coordinates of a html element. I found a copy of the drag and drop can be achieved using simple javascript code, but I wish to build the app in React JS. There are examples in the internet which shows how the drag and drop works in react, but I am yet find a concrete example.

### Day 1: 16-12-2019


**Today's Progress**: Was able to move the div component, although not properly

**Thoughts:** Need to understand how to capture dom positions in react.

### Day 2: 17-12-2019


**Today's Progress**:
                    1. Added react-bootstrap from https://react-bootstrap.github.io/
                    2. Implemented Menu
                    3. Implemented Drag from Menu


**Thoughts:** Need to understand how to bootstrap works with react, would probably need to implement Redux for dragging element. Need to implement multiple drags from the menu.

### Day 3: 18-12-2019


**Today's Progress**:
                    1. Implemented multiple drags.


**Thoughts:** Struggled with multiple drags but ultimately won :) There is an obvious need for an centralised store of data and from what I gather redux might be the answer. Although am getting good with javascript, I think I need to understand ES6 notation at some point.

### Day 4: 19-12-2019- 20-12-2019(2:27 am)


**Today's Progress**:
                    1. Tried and failed to implemented redux


**Thoughts:** Implementing redux might have been a mistake :(

### Day 5: 20-12-2019- 21-12-2019(1:43 am)


**Today's Progress**:
                    1. Implemented Redux and allow multiple item drag.
                    2. Implemented individual drag.


**Thoughts:** Really good learning of how redux works. Getting a hang of how to write imperative coding. Redux might not be so bad. Next is to join elements which might be a bit of challenge.

### Day 6: 21-12-2019- 22-12-2019(0:33 am)


**Today's Progress**:
                    1. Added multiple options to the menu.
                    2. Renamed few file to make it generic.


**Thoughts:** Need to find a way to have connectors, need to work on a solution to delete items from the canvas. Need to understand how css works.

### Day 7: 22-12-2019- 23-12-2019(0:13 am)


**Today's Progress**:
                    1. Added code for Line drag.


**Thoughts:** Found out svg will work for line, and tested creating svg in the app. Probably need to think about the react structure.

### Day 8: 23-12-2019- 24-12-2019(1:18 am)


**Today's Progress**:
                    1. Started working on another as a POC for Line drag


**Thoughts:** Need to get a working draw application. It might not be as easy as I was thinking about it.

### Day 9: 24-12-2019- 25-12-2019(0:46 am)


**Today's Progress**:
                    Finished POC, used svg to draw straight lines.


**Thoughts:** There are multiple ways of drawing lines in js, we can use canvas, a library konva which as a react plugin react-konva. I have used plain js and svg to draw lines. Next up I need to make line draw work in Process model app, may be in future I will add more functionality in the draw app.

**Today's Progress**:
                    Continued POC to select and delete lines. sucessful partially.


**Thoughts:** Learnt about event.persist() . I need to learn how react works to make the most of the library. Need to change color of the object when selected.

### Day 13: 28-12-2019 - 29-12-2019 (0:20 am)


**Today's Progress**:
                    Draw: Able to draw the multi-select box


**Thoughts:** Laptop charger is miracalously working fine since morning :) The bootstrap is making stuff weird, for now removed the code. I was able to draw the multi select box, need to add caclulation for selection. Need to clean up the code. Going as planned for now. Should be able to implement these features in the process modeler app.

### Day 14: 29-12-2019 - 30-12-2019 (0:55 am)


**Today's Progress**:
                    Draw: Made multi select work, looks pretty cool


**Thoughts:** Made the multi select work. It is looking pretty good. I have some idea about how to make the select box work more like a drag than two clicks. There are some bugs with the generation of selection box which needs to be fixed, but all in all I am pretty happy with how the work has gone. At some point of time I think I will move back to the process modeler app, but I plan to keep the Draw app running, adding features to it whenever I can.

### Day 15: 30-12-2019 (23:38 pm) 


**Today's Progress**:
                    Draw: Fixed the bug with multi select.
                    Process model: Changed elements into svg.


**Thoughts:** Stopped working on the draw app after fixing the bug, more enhancements can be added but I will add them later. Working on the process model app now. Changed all elements into svg instead of css, I feel its easier to maintain the code but the problem is drag events doesnt work in svg, hence need to find a combination of onMouseDown, onMove and onMouseUp. The new combination should help with drawing lines. Theoritically I think its possible but I need a clear head to work on this problem.

### Day 16: 31-12-2019 (2:00 am) 


**Today's Progress**:
                    Process model: Changed the code to make drag work with a combination of MouseDown,MouseMove and MouseUp movement.


**Thoughts:** Could not sleep at night, so decided to code for a while, ended up working for 2 hours, this involved writing notes in my notebook and coding. I certainly think writing down the logic in a notebook and then coding it makes the job easier. I have written the logic of how to make the line draw work. Next up  coding the line draw.

### Day 17: 1-1-2020 (23:54 pm) 


**Today's Progress**:
                    Process model: Created a new state element for Line Select.


**Thoughts:** Could not give my full attention to the app, changed the code a bit to accomodate line select. Need to code the line draw.

### Day 18: 2-1-2020 (23:54 pm) 


**Today's Progress**:
                    Process model: Drew lines from element


**Thoughts:** Need to rethink about lines. Need to draw lines via elements, lines cannot exists independently and needs to tied into element.

### Day 19: 3-1-2020 (19:31 pm) 


**Today's Progress**:
                    Process model: Drew lines from element and attached them to other elements.


**Thoughts:** I am very happy with my progress, am not able to move the line along with the element drag. Next up, I need to select element and delete them. Should be straight forward given I have the code in the Draw app.

### Day 28: 12-1-2020

**Today's Progress**:
                    Started working on a Tetris app from a freecodecamp youtube video


**Thoughts:** I decided to take a break from the process modeler app, in order to understand how others use React and particularly game programming is done in React. The output of this learning I am hoping is to understand enough of game code,extract the knowledge and then implement them into the process modeler app.

**Today's Progress**:
                   Removed SVG components and replaced them with styled components


**Thoughts:**   Removed SVG components and replaced them with styled components. I think it will help me get capture keyboard events. Need to work on collision detection. Watched multiple videos of p5.js it might be fun to learn.
