# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 16-12-2019


**Today's Progress**: Started a brand new project for my process model app using react js

**Thoughts:** I am struggling with finding the right attributes to get the coordinates of a html element. I found a copy of the drag and drop can be achieved using simple javascript code, but I wish to build the app in React JS. There are examples in the internet which shows how the drag and drop works in react, but I am yet find a concrete example.

**Today's Progress**: Was able to move the div component, although not properly
